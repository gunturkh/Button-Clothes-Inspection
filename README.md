# Button-Clothes-Inspection
Inspection machine to sort Good/No Good Button clothes on the conveyor based on size and the hole in the middle of it. Based on the Python 3 and OpenCV Library

Made for my Final project on Mechatronic Degree at Politeknik Negeri Batam, Kepulauan Riau, Indonesia. The goal is to make a prototype machine for inspecting button clothes, which the sorter later in this project are the Delta Robot Manipulator which i communicate to using serial port. The program i made basically doing some image acquisition, checking if they are good/no good, and send the position through the serial port.
